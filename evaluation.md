## Internal DSL

_Describe each change from your ideal syntax to the syntax you implemented, and
describe_ why _you made the change._
Because this was an internal DSL and due to how the given libraries were implmented, I could not use keywords like if and else so I had to instead use beginning states like ifFacingEast, which maintains the conditional statement resemblance I was seeking. Additionally, I combined the statements for open and blocked as well as those for move and face because I was unable to find out how to make each of these occur separately then combine them post being called.

**On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "a lot"), how much did you have to change your syntax?**
I had to change my syntax about a 7 on a scale of 1-10. The language is much more verbose and hence much less resembles a programming language as I had originally desired.

**On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "very difficult"), how difficult was it to map your syntax to the provided API?**
It was like a 9 difficulty to map my syntax onto the provided API. It was very difficult to handle errors which meant I was getting stuck for much longer than I had originally anticipated.
